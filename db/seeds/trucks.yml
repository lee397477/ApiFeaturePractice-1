    This lovely marvel of modern machinery is a huge, mobile pizza oven housed
    in a former shippin container— on wheels. It churns out Neapolitan-style
    pizzas with seasonal toppings like asaparagus with green garlic pesto, or
    the classic Margherita.

    This truck fuses together the delights of a Mexican taqueria with a popular
    Filipino "happy hour dish" called sisig. For more authentic flavors,
    Tosilog burrito rolls up Filipino Sweet Pork, adobo garlic rice, fresh
    tomatoes with a fried egg and a side of peppered vinegar; meanwhile the
    California burrito is not messing around, stuffing French fries, shredded
    cheese, sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo into a tortilla.

    While food trucks are pushing the envelope of street food these days (Bacon
    bouquets? Potsticker burrito?), sometimes a good ol' fashioned sandwich is
    still the best option for lunch. However, the turkey club on a Dutch crunch
    offers a sneak-attack of flavors and textures.

    The Lobsta Truck is a crustacean-focused affair, offering lobster and crab
    rolls, savory lobster bisque and other New England fare like Cape Cod
    chips. Snag a freshly-squeezed lemonade and imagine you're in the
    Northeast, which is probably nice this time of year.

    The Boneyard is a bonanza of smoked meats, featuring brisket nachos, bbq
    bowls and the "pulled over," a sandwich with pulled pork, cole slaw, spicy
    bacon aioli and a fried egg. The Bay Area's not known for its BBQ, but this
    truck will satisfy the itch of many a meat-lover.

    Their claim to fame as the first frozen custard truck in California is
    overshadowed by an immense menu of flavors. What is custard, if not a
    vessel for flavors like Four Barrel Coffee, yuzu sake, matcha and salt and
    pepper potato chip? Top it off with some sprinkles, condensed milk or burnt
    caramel for a truly summery, feel-good treat.
